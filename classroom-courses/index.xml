      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a popular graduate elective, that used to give an overview of both Data warehousing and Data Mining. I used to teach this jointly with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~psk&#34;&gt;Prof. P. Sreenivasa Kumar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have modified this course to focus more on dealing with massive amounts of data. Please see the Moodle page for more details. In 2014 I offered this jointly with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sayan&#34;&gt;Dr. Sayan Ranu&lt;/a&gt;. This course is typically offered in the Jan-May semester.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first course on comptuer science for the CS majors. The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the various aspects of CS and E, and try and get them excited about the subject. I taught it for the first time in Aug-Dec 2009. I am on the look out for innovative ideas to motivate the students: could be lecure ideas, lab exercises, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course covers the basics of statistical machine learning, with an emphasis on programming exercises and projects. This is usually taught in the Aug-Dec semeter by Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti. I taught this course for the first time in Aug-Dec 2013. Please see the Moodle page for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/classroom-courses/intro-to-operating-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an undergraduate core course. It was earlier taught as a combined course, but in the recent semesters has a separate lab section. The course is designed to be a hands-on introduction, with the students learning as much in the laboratory as they do in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a core course for the minor on robotics. I co-teach this with Prof. Asokan, ED, and Prof. Krishna Vasudevan, EE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course gives an introduction to statistical approaches to natural language processing. I teach this jointly with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sutanuc&#34;&gt;Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti&lt;/a&gt;. We offered this course in Aug-Dec 2009 for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Probabilistic Reasoning in AI</title>

      <guid>/classroom-courses/probabilistic-reasoning-in-ai/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a self-study elective course that I also offer as a contact course for research scholars on demand. I put together a program of weekly reading and written assignments, and a final presentation. The topics covered are a mixture of Bayesian networks, graphical models, approximate inferencing, sequential decision making and reasoning under uncertainty. Recently, this course has come to focus more on approximate inferencing in graphical models, and their applications. In 2014 I offered this as a taught course, with focus on more recent developments in the field. Please see the Moodle page for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <guid>/classroom-courses/reinforcement-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a graduate level elective that introduces students to the basics of the reinforcement learning paradigm. The focus of the course is more on the pragmatic rather than on the technical details. The bulk of the credit is earned through programming assignments. The course is typically offered in the Aug-Dec semester.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social Network Analysis</title>

      <guid>/classroom-courses/social-network-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Analyzing patterns of interactions among/within communities has been in the domain of sociologists for long. With the mind numbing growth of digitally recorded interactions, via e-mail, web 2.0, even citations, etc., both the amount of readily accessible data and powerful tools to process them have seen a quantum leap. The objective of the course is to serve as an introduction to the various sources of network data, the different kinds of networks that one can construct from them, the various properties of these networks that people study-motivate this from a sociological point of view, the computation of these properties-from a graph algorithm point of view, look at growth models of network and methods to study the evolution of such networks. The course will have a heavy graph algorithm bias, and will also require some linear algebra and probability theory concepts. I intend to run this course as a part seminar course. Since 2014 I run this as a self-study course for the undergrads and as a directed study for research scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
